# RV Electrical Conversion / Upgrade

## OEM 1995 Chevy P30 30A

Goal of this project is to completely upgrade the electrical system of this 30A OEM Chevy P30. The stock OEM electrical system is shown in the diagram below.

The primary flaw in the OEM config is the Magnetek Series 950 Converter being unable to do any smart charging of the batteries, so when the RV is plugged into shore power it is very slow to charge the aux batteries and actually wears down the starter battery do to overcharge when the RV is plugged in for extended periods of time.

## Planned Conversion to LiFePO4 and Solar

The major upgrades of this conversion are as follows:
1. Replace the 2 series connected 6V lead acid Aux batteries with 8 LiFePO4 cells in a series configuration, creating a 24V 280Ah battery bank with a power capacity of 7.2kWh.  Moving from 12V to 24V for the house battery increases the power density of the whole system and enables it to be wired with thinner cables to cut down on cost.
2. Remove the Magnetek power converter from the system completely and replace it with a combination of a 12V to 24V charger that converts the output of the alternator to charge the house batteries while driving, and an all-in-one solar charger inverter that will not overcharge the starter or house batteries when the RV is plugged in for extended periods.     
3. Install at least 1200W of solar panels (will increase to 1400-1500W if a 7th panel can fit on the roof of the RV).  Panels to be mounted in a way that allows them to be tilted toward the sun when it is lower in the sky during the winter, improving the solar power generated by roughly 50%.
4. The system will be managed by the SunGold Power All-in-one Solar Charge Inverter which combines a 40A passthrough AC battery charger with an 80A MPPT solar charge controller and a 3000W inverter.
5. For ease of routing and cable management a Victron Lynx Power In will be modified to function identically to a Lynx distributor.
6. A current shunt and power monitor will be installed to measure inputs and outputs to the battery and report back the state of charge to a Raspberry Pi running Venus OS that will mimic the functionallity of the Victron Cerbo GX.
7. Lastly a 24V to 12V DC power converter will be needed to step down the 24V from the battery bank to power the existing 12V infrastructure.
   
The system diagram after the conversion is shown below.

## Cost savings

A major goal of this project is to keep cost as low as possible without sacrificing any functionality or performance.  All in all a total cost of under $2,500 for this project (not counting any of my labor), is ridiculously cheap when to buy an equivalent system and have it installed would cost north of $12,000.  The key areas where cost was able to be spared was:

1. Obtaining the solar panels from OfferUp.  I managed to find 7 panels capable of producing 1470W of solar power for only $250.
2. Only using Victron equipment where it made sense and when we did to buy that equipment used. For comparison the Victron Multiplus inverter would be $1300 and not include a solar controller, whereas the SunGold All-in-one was only $649.
3. Using a Raspberry Pi for the system monitoring and reporting along with a cheap display could be done for less than $50, but a Victron Cerbo GX and Cerbo Screen would cost over $600.
4. Building the 24V battery from individual cells instead of buying pre-assembled Lithium batteries saved roughly 50% on the cost and allowed us to use a better BMS that would monitor all the cells and keep them all balanced, thus extending their life and increasing performance.

As you can see the from the total cost breakdown below the batteries and the all-in-one were roughly 1/3 of the total cost each with all the remaining components making up the last 1/3.
